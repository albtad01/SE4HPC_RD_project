This is the Requirement Engineering and Design project for the Software Engineering for HPC course @ Politecnico di Milano. Objective of this project is create a document with focus on requirement analysis and design based on a given problem. This project has been awarded the maximum grade.

### The Problem
Based on the problem of air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and transportation, our task was to develop a solution for the project "Eco-City Commute" (ECC), which aims to create a comprehensive software system that makes public transportation within an urban area as easy and efficient as possible, promoting its adoption. Specifically, we had to focus on the requirements analysis and design work related to the features dedicated to both types of stakeholders mentioned. Further information about the problem and the assignment rules can be found [here](https://github.com/luca-simei/SE4HPC_RD_project/blob/main/Specification/RD_project.pdf).

### Stakeholders
ECC offers services to two types of stakeholders:  
* __Citizens__: ECC offers a mobile app that allows citizens to input the origin and the 
destination of their trips within the urban area, together with any constraint they have 
(e.g., they do not want to use a bike, or they must arrive at destination within a certain 
timeframe). The app will compute for them environmentally friendly routes, possibly 
combining different transportation means.  
* __Urban area managers__: ECC offers to managers a dashboard through which they can 
visualize reports concerning the daily usage of the various available transportation 
means, their occupation rates and delays (if any).

### Our Solution
We developed a service named _EcoWay_ as a solution to the mentioned problems, with the purpose of encouraging people to use their vehicles less and opt for healthier alternatives, such as bicycles, which benefit both them and the environment. From the users' point of view, itâ€™s an application that offers an analysis of the best route for their travels, with the possibility to borrow bicycles managed by an external organization. Additionally, it allows users to check timetables for trams and other public transportation and to purchase tickets directly online. Urban Area Managers can analyze various data from a private dashboard and either share it or contact external partners directly. The final document with further information can be found [here](https://github.com/luca-simei/SE4HPC_RD_project/blob/main/EcoWay.pdf).
